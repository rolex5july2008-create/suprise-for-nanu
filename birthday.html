    <h1>Happy Birthday, Nanu 🎂</h1>

    <p>
      I know this is an advance birthday wish~<br>
      Not because I couldn’t wait~ but because circumstances didn’t really give me a choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since you’ll be going to hostel and won’t have your phone with you~<br>
      I didn’t want to miss the chance to tell you how important this day is to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wanted you to have this with you~<br>
      something you can come back to~ even when I’m not around to say it in real time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m really grateful the world got you~<br>
      And even more grateful that...somehow~ I got close enough to know you.
    </p>
