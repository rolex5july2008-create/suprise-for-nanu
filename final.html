    <h1>Just one last thing</h1>

    <p>
      I don’t think this really needs an ending.  
      Some things feel better when they’re just left open.
    </p>

    <p>
      I made this knowing there will be days when we’re busy, tired, or a little far from each other.  
      And I wanted you to have something that feels familiar on those days.  
      Something that doesn’t demand anything from you.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m really grateful for how naturally we found each other.  
      For the calls that stretched late into the night.  
      For the way conversations felt easy, even when we weren’t saying much.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn’t meant to be big or dramatic.  
      It’s just a quiet reminder that you matter to me in simple, steady ways.  
      The kind that don’t disappear when things get quiet.
    </p>

    <p>
      So whenever you come back to this,  
      whether you’re smiling or just resting,  
      I hope it feels soft.  
      Like something warm you can lean into for a moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m here.  
      Gently.  
      And always choosing you.
    </p>
