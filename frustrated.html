    <h1>When you’re frustrated</h1>

    <p>
      Breathe, darling… breathe for a second.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m guessing something didn’t go the way you wanted, or maybe everything just
      feels annoying right now. I know that kind of frustration — when everything
      feels irritating and nothing really helps.
    </p>

    <p>
      When your brain feels cluttered with too many things at once, like there’s no
      solution to anything and your heart just feels heavy. It’s annoying. I know.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t have to sort everything out right now. Take a pause. It’s okay.
      You don’t have to think clearly immediately or try to find a solution right now —
      not with that cluttered head of yours.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wish I could remind you of how capable you actually are… especially on days
      when you forget. Even when things feel messy, I trust you more than you trust
      yourself in these moments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Take a pause. You’re allowed to slow down.
      You don’t have to rush into anything. Just slow down a little.
    </p>
