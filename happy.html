    <h1>When you’re happy</h1>

    <p>
      If you're opening this because you're genuinely happy right now..  
      I can already picture you smiling, your heart racing even faster —  
      the jumps of joy and those cute little happy crash outs.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you're happy, you light up the people around you.  
      I’ll be honest — I start giggling and kicking my feet just because  
      you’re happy, and that cheers me up so much.
    </p>

    <p>
      You tell me how happy you are without even realizing it..  
      your tone changes, your mood changes, and you sound soooo happyyyy.
    </p>

    <p>
      I freaking loveee that about you.  
      I love how your happiness isn’t quiet or contained~ it’s honest.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wish I could be there when it happens..  
      to see you all cheered up, to laugh with you,  
      to let that happiness bounce around between us.
    </p>

    <p>
      So if you’re feeling like that right now, don’t tone it down.  
      Don’t shrink it.  
      Let it blossom like a flower.
    </p>
