    <h1>Something I wanted to say</h1>

    <p>
      I’ve been thinking about you going to hostel~
      and how quiet things might feel without our usual calls.
    </p>

    <p>
      We got close in a way I didn’t really plan~
      late nights, random conversations, comfortable silence~
      the kind that doesn’t need effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know this is just a month~
      but I’d be lying if I said I won’t miss hearing your voice at night.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still~
      I’m grateful for what we shared~
      and for how naturally it happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      So take this with you~
      not as something heavy~
      but as something warm.
    </p>
