    <h1>When you’re overthinking</h1>

    <p>
      If you’re opening this because your mind won’t slow down right now…
      I understand completely. I get it. I really do.
    </p>

    <p>
      The urge to find answers to all those “what ifs”, the hundreds of questions
      running inside that head of yours, or even just wanting someone to calm
      those thoughts down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Breathe a little… slow down.
      Even if you feel like you’re in a rush — still, slow down.
      Breathe. Pull yourself back for a second.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, you don’t have to solve anything or find answers.
      You don’t need clarity or conclusions at this moment.
      What you really need is to put the brakes on yourself for a bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing bad is happening in this exact moment.
      Even if your thoughts are loud, you’re still here. You’re still safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know your brain likes to replay things — what you said, what you didn’t say,
      what could’ve been different. But not every thought deserves your energy.
      Some thoughts are just tired thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Baccha… it’s okay.
      If I were there, I’d just remind you to breathe and help you untangle those
      thoughts gently, without rushing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just slow breaths. There’s no pressure to calm down instantly.
      Some things make more sense after rest.
