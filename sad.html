    <h1>When you’re sad</h1>

    <p>
      I wish I could be there... in the simplest ways.
      Not to fix anything, not to say the right words.
      Just to sit next to you and feel that moment together.
    </p>

    <p>
      I keep imagining sitting right beside you,
      your head on my shoulder,
      letting the silence do the talking.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t have to be strong.
      You don’t have to pretend you’re “okay”.
      You don’t have to make sense of how you feel,
      even if it’s something that wasn’t your fault.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s okay if everything feels like too much...
      if it feels like a burden,
      or like one of the worst moments you’ve ever faced,
      or even if it’s just that quiet “I’m used to this” feeling.
    </p>

    <p>
      I just want you to gently remember that someone cares about you
      quietly and constantly.
      And even if today feels small or tiring,
      every mood of yours,
      every little emotion,
      every single damn thing matters more than you realize.
    </p>

    <p>
      Take your time.
      I’m not going anywhere.
      I’ll always be by your side...
      choosing you every single day.
    </p>
